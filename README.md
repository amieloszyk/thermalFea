# thermalFea
First try at thermal conduction FEA using C++

This is my first C++ project and it is very much a learning experience on how to use it.


Things to do:

    - [x] Verify that code works in current state (patch test of Milos elements)
    - [ ] Reorganize file structure (src, build, bin, include, doc, examples, scripts, tests, gui)
    - [ ] Reorganize / create code execution structure
    - [ ] Create an input data structure
    - [ ] Create an output structure
    - [ ] Create a run log
    - [ ] Create a parallel solver
    - [ ] Create isoparametric and triangular elements
    - [ ] Implement better loads interface
    - [ ] Implement better BC interface
    - [ ] Implement global element numbering
    - [ ] Implement node and element sets
    - [ ] Implement temperature (state variable?) dependent thermal conductivity
    - [ ] Implement method to get calculated heat fluxes from the mesh
    
    - [ ] Create a gui
    - [ ] Create a build system
    - [ ] Create a user manual
